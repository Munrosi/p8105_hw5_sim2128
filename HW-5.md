# Problem 1

Create a function that replaces missing numeric values with the column
mean, and replace missing character variables with “virginica”, then map
it over the dataset.

``` r
replace_x = function(x) {
  if (is.numeric(x) == T) {
  x[is.na(x)] = (mean(x, na.rm = T))}
  else {
   x[is.na(x)] = "virginica" }
  x
}
iris_with_missing = map_df(iris_with_missing, replace_x)
```

# Problem 2

*Import the zip file and create a dataframe with all the csv files*

``` r
library(readr)
library(purrr)

files <- list.files(path="./Data/unzipped", pattern =".*csv")

hw5_df <- map_df(paste("./Data/unzipped", files, sep = "/"), 
                 read_csv ) %>% 
  mutate(
    participants = files ,
    participants = str_remove(participants, ".csv")) %>%
  separate(participants, into = c("arm", "subject_id"), sep = "_") %>%
  mutate(
    arm = str_replace(arm, "con", "control"),
    arm = str_replace(arm, "exp", "experimental"),
    subject_id = c(1:20)
  ) %>%
  select(arm, subject_id, everything())
```

*Make a spaghetti plot showing the subject’s observations over time by
arm*

``` r
hw5_df %>%
  pivot_longer(
    week_1:week_8,
    names_to = "weeks",
    values_to = "observations"
  ) %>%

ggplot(aes(x = weeks, y = observations, group = subject_id, color = arm)) + geom_line()
```
